Description:
This script takes editor-based groups and respawns them when the group is eliminated
The group's waypoints are saved
The group's loadouts are saved
Multiple respawn positions are available
Spawning can be synchronized with a trigger to create groups when needed
The number of respawns can be set, or it can respawn infinitely
The respawn delay can be a fixed number or a range
A pause radius is available so groups don't spawn on top of other units
An exit trigger can be used to exit the script early
Integrated GAIA support

A custom init string can be used to run your favourite patrol script, attack script, gear script, etc.
Units are added to Zeus automatically
Use it for ambient combat, waves of attackers, random patrols or whatever else you think of.....

"DEBUG"					= Will provide debugging information
